# legal-matchings
Code verifying the properties of the basis vectors in the article "Convex characters, algorithms and matchings" by Kelk, Meuwese and Wagner.

The Check62Vectors.nb file is an annotated Mathematica file verifying that the 62 vectors have the properties described in Theorem 6 of the article. See also the Appendix of the article.

Check62Vectors.pdf is a PDF export of the Mathematica file, after running it to termination.

LegalMatchingsBetterBound_Version_13_November_2021.nn is an annotated Mathematica file verifying that the 64 vectors achieving the slightly improved bound of O((19/12)^n), and which are discussed in the last part of the paper, also have the desired properties. The PDF file is the output of this file.

The files were executed under Mathematica 12 running under Windows 10, on a 64-bit HP Envy Laptop 13-ad0xx (quad-core
i7-7500 @ 2.7 GHz), with 8 Gb of memory. Check62Vectors executes in less than a minute, but LegalMatchingsBetterBound_Version_13_November_2021 takes somewhat longer,
approximately 1 hour.
